# Predict-Customer-Buying-Behaviour
# Introduction
This project aims to predict customer buying behavior based on various features related to flight bookings. The dataset contains information such as the day of the week, number of passengers, purchase lead time, and more. The objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer will complete a flight booking.
